# unity-floor-plan-jb

Spent roughly 15 hours working on the task.

Managed to create a scene where the user can click to place a corner, and drag from that point to create walls.
As the user drags, the length of the wall will display alongside the cursor.
There is currently nothing restricting the user from creating walls that do not connect.

If the user connects a wall to the starting point, and there are at least 4 points, the area bound by the 4 corners will be calculated
and displayed.
The FillArea then tries to add a quad to that area to highlight the area. This currently doesn't work very well, as the center point
of the quad can be a bit off once the bounds are recalculated.

Created a scriptable object to hold a list of the points created. Wanted to create a way to load this with a button to recreate
a stored room.

Issues:
No restriction on direction user can draw walls, no restriction on creating walls that do not connect.
The fill does not correctly map to the area.

Wasn't able to complete any of the other requested functionallity.
